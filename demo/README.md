# demo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Environment Configuration (.env)

1. Set `API_BASE_URL` in `.env` to your own machine's local IP and backend port.
2. Make sure your phone or emulator is on the same network as your backend server.
3. Do NOT commit your actual `.env` fileâ€”it's ignored in git!
