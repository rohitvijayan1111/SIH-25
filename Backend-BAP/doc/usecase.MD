Thanks for sharing your well-structured `bap_agri_db` schema. Based on this schema, here's the **corrected and mapped set of BAP (Beckn API Platform – Consumer Side) backend use cases**, aligned with your actual tables, including field-level alignment and data flow.

---

# ✅ 📲 BAP Use Cases – Aligned to `bap_agri_db`

---

## 🔍 1. Initiate Search (`/search` → `/on_search`)

### 📌 Goal:

User searches for products or services (e.g., agri inputs). BAP sends `/search`, stores input, and processes `/on_search`.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Collect search query and optional filters (category).
* Save in `search_requests`.
* Generate a transaction ID and send `/search` to the Beckn network.
* Process `/on_search` responses from BPP(s), store or cache them if needed (optional table not included in current schema).

### 🗃️ Involved Table:

* `search_requests`

---

## 🛒 2. Item Selection (`/select` → `/on_select`)

### 📌 Goal:

User selects item(s) from BPP. Confirm availability, price, and store selection.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Send `/select` with selected item IDs and BPP reference.
* Await `/on_select` for validation.
* Temporarily save this in session or frontend; DB persistence is optional (you can use a `cart` table if needed).

### 🗃️ Tables:

* No DB persistence required as per current schema.
* Could extend `orders` with a "draft" status if needed.

---

## 📝 3. Order Initialization (`/init` → `/on_init`)

### 📌 Goal:

Send user’s address, logistics preferences, and payment mode. Lock price and fulfillment details.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Create a new entry in `orders` (status = `INITIATED`).
* Add `order_items` for each item in the cart.
* Insert into `logistics_preferences` based on pickup/drop info.
* Store BPP response from `/on_init` for rendering quote.

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `orders`
* `order_items`
* `logistics_preferences`

---

## ✅ 4. Confirm Order (`/confirm` → `/on_confirm`)

### 📌 Goal:

Confirm order placement after payment initiation.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Send `/confirm` request with transaction reference.
* Update `orders.status` to `CONFIRMED`.
* Insert into `payment_transactions` with status `PENDING`.
* After `/on_confirm`, proceed with fulfillment tracking.

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `orders`
* `payment_transactions`

---

## 🚚 5. Track Order Status (`/status` → `/on_status`)

### 📌 Goal:

Fetch and display fulfillment progress.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Send `/status` with order reference.
* On receiving `/on_status`, update `order_tracking`.

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `order_tracking`

---

## 🧾 6. Final Bill (`/bill` → `/on_bill`)

### 📌 Goal:

Show itemized invoice + logistics charges to the user.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Receive `/on_bill` from BPP.
* Update `orders.total_amount`.
* Optionally store `invoice_url` or itemized breakdown (add-on schema required if needed).

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `orders`
* `order_items` (already contains unit price and quantity)

---

## ✍️ 7. Ratings (`/rating` → `/on_rating`)

### 📌 Goal:

Collect post-fulfillment feedback from users.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* User gives rating on BPP/order.
* Send `/rating`.
* On `/on_rating`, store feedback.

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `ratings`

---

## ❌ 8. Cancel Order (`/cancel` → `/on_cancel`)

### 📌 Goal:

Allow users to cancel active orders before dispatch.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Send `/cancel` to BPP.
* On `/on_cancel`, update `orders.status = CANCELLED`.
* Log event in `order_tracking`.

### 🗃️ Tables:

* `orders`
* `order_tracking`

---

## 🔔 9. Notifications (Internal Use)

### 📌 Goal:

Send messages for order status, payments, system alerts.

### ✅ Backend Flow:

* Generate entry in `notifications` per user action/event.
* Update `status` based on delivery attempts.

### 🗃️ Table:

* `notifications`

🔁 When This Happens:
After receiving /on_search and /on_select from BPP

Before calling /init to finalize order

🎯 Why Needed:
The BAP must temporarily store selected items, especially in multi-item or multi-BPP flows, before constructing the final /init payload.


✅ Use Case Name: Add to Cart (Pre-Init Phase)
📌 Goal:
Allow users to select products and quantities before placing an order, similar to an e-commerce cart.

| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛒 **Product Listing**     | `/search` + local UI  | This is when the user first browses products. You call the **Beckn `/search` API**, and render the response in your frontend (React, Vue, etc.). You can style/sort/filter results locally.                                                                                                              |
| 🧾 **Product Detail Page** | `/on_select`          | When the user clicks on a product, you send a **`/select`** to the BPP with the product ID. The BPP responds with **`/on_select`**, which contains **complete product details** (description, pricing, available packs, etc.). This powers your **product details page**.                                |
| 📥 **My Cart Page**        | *Local DB or Session* | The ONDC protocol does **not handle cart logic**. You must **store cart items locally**: either in your backend database (`db_cart`) for logged-in users or in frontend/session storage for guest users. The **cart page** uses this local data to render added products.                                |
| 🧾 **Final Checkout**      | `/init → /on_init`    | When a user clicks **"Place Order"** for one product, you send an **`/init`** request to the BPP. The BPP responds with **`/on_init`**, which contains locked order info like **final price, taxes, delivery address, and estimated delivery time**. You show this on your final review/checkout screen. |
| ✅ **Confirm Order**        | `/confirm`            | After the user reviews everything and clicks **"Confirm Order"**, you send a **`/confirm`** API to the BPP. This places the order and completes the ONDC protocol flow. You may redirect the user to payment or order success page.                                                                      |
