# 📦 Backend Use Cases for BPP (Beckn Protocol Provider)

This document outlines how the **BPP (Beckn Protocol Provider)** backend interacts with the **Beckn network** APIs and internal systems. It details each use case, its purpose, backend logic, and the associated database tables.

---

## 🔍 1. Respond to Search (`/on_search`)

**📌 Goal**:
Respond to `/search` calls from a BAP (Buyer App Provider) with a list of available products and their pricing.

**✅ Backend Responsibilities**:

* Fetch products from `products` table.
* Fetch latest valid pricing from `price_list` where current date is between `valid_from` and `valid_to`.
* Include metadata from:

  * `farmers` (provider info),
  * `locations` (location\_id and address),
  * `catalog_fulfillments` (fulfillment info).
* Ensure stock is greater than 0.
* Return products in a Beckn-compliant JSON format.

**🧩 Tables Involved**:

* `products`
* `price_list`
* `farmers`
* `locations`
* `catalog_fulfillments`

---

## 🛒 2. Respond to Selection (`/on_select`)

**📌 Goal**:
Confirm availability and pricing of selected items before order placement.

**✅ Backend Responsibilities**:

* Validate product availability (`products.stock`).
* Verify price validity (`price_list`).
* Optionally check historical inventory changes (`inventory_logs`).
* Provide fulfillment details from `catalog_fulfillments`.

**🧩 Tables Involved**:

* `products`
* `price_list`
* `inventory_logs` *(optional)*
* `catalog_fulfillments`

Absolutely! Here's a **short and great version** of the **`/on_init` use case** along with the **tables used** on the **BPP side**:

---

## 2.5 ✅ `/on_init` Use Case (BPP Side)

### 🔹 Purpose:

Lock final **price, items, stock, and delivery info** before BAP collects payment.

---

### 🔁 When It Happens:

After `/init` from BAP → BPP responds with `/on_init`.

---

### 📦 What BPP Includes in `/on_init`:

| Field         | Description                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `items[]`     | Product IDs, quantity, unit price |
| `quote`       | Final total + item-wise breakup   |
| `fulfillment` | Delivery/pickup info + ETA        |
| `payment`     | Type, status = `NOT-PAID`, TTL    |

---

### 🧠 Real World Analogy:

> Like freezing your cart price and stock before paying on Amazon.

---

### 🗃️ BPP Tables Used:

| Table                  | Used For                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `products`             | Get current stock and product info       |
| `price_list`           | Fetch latest valid price per unit        |
| `catalog_fulfillments` | Provide delivery/pickup address and ETA  |
| `inventory_logs` (opt) | Log/validate historical stock (optional) |

---

### ✅ After `/on_init`:

1. BAP **shows quote to user**
2. BAP **collects payment**
3. BAP sends `/confirm` with `transaction_id`
