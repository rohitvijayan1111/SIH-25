# FairAgri Supply Chain â€“ SIH 2025

## ðŸšœ Problem Statement

Every day, millions of farmers across India toil tirelessly in their fields. Yet, when it comes time to sell their produce, they often struggle to get a **fair price**.  

Middlemen â€” who control storage and transport â€” exploit loopholes with inflated deals and underhand payments, leaving farmers underpaid and vulnerable. Removing middlemen isnâ€™t simple either, because logistics and warehousing are essential.  

Customers, meanwhile, lack visibility into the journey of their food. They see only a price tag â€” not the true value. **Trust is missing**, and the supply chain remains opaque and unfair.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview

Our solution restores **transparency, fairness, and trust** to the agricultural supply chain using **ONDC + Hyperledger Fabric**.

- **ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce)**  
  A government-backed network that connects farmers, middlemen, logistics providers, and customers. Ensures open competition and prevents monopolistic practices.

- **Hyperledger Fabric**  
  A permissioned blockchain where **only verified participants** can join. Every sale, bid, or purchase is recorded in a **tamper-proof ledger**, ensuring accountability and traceability. Farmers get fair prices, middlemen remain accountable, and customers can track produce from farm to plate.

## ðŸ›¡ Fraud Detection Logic

- **Overpriced in system but underhand deals**  
  ONDC ensures competing middlemen can bid fairly, exposing discrepancies and enforcing transparency.

- **Underpriced in system but paid more underhand**  
  Blockchain ensures ledger consistency. Any mismatch is automatically detected, preventing fraud.

## âœ… Key Benefits

- **Transparency:** Tamper-proof transaction records.  
- **Fair Pricing:** Competitive, honest pricing for farmers.  
- **Traceability:** Track produce from farm to fork.  
- **Open Network:** ONDC prevents monopolies, encourages fair competition.  
- **Fraud Prevention:** Ledger consistency detects discrepancies automatically.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitvijayan1111/SIH-25
cd FairAgri-SIH2025
```

2. **Setup Backend (ONDC + Node.js):**  
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
The backend server will run at `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port). Connect it to the **Hyperledger Fabric** network for blockchain operations.

3. **Setup Flutter Frontend (Mobile & Web App):**  
```bash
cd ../frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
This will launch the mobile/web app connected to the backend.

4. **Verify Integration:**  
- Ensure the backend is running before starting the Flutter app.  
- Test blockchain interactions, batch tracking, and ONDC API calls through the app.


## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- IoT-based real-time produce tracking  
- Dynamic bidding system for farmers  
- Mobile notifications for price updates and transactions  
- AI-driven demand forecasting for better pricing
